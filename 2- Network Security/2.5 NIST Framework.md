## Scenario 

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.
During the attack, your organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 
The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 
To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 
A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics
As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company’s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). You will use the CSF to help you navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity incident and integrate your analysis into a general security strategy:

1. Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 
2. Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 
3. Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 
4. Respond to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 
5. Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.

## Respond

### Summary
ICMP/ping flood attack is possible due to multiple compromised systems sending a huge volume of ICMP echo requests to the target. In this case, ICMP/ping flood causes network services to become unresponsive or stop working. Then, the organization decided to block the flood attack and stop all non-critical network services to overcome the disruptions caused by denial of services (DDos) through incoming ICMP/Ping flood packets. 

### NIST CSF 
| No | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | `Summary` affected systems or data: <br> - Recovery planning: How will resources be restored following an attack? <br> - Improvements: Do any improvements need to be made to the current recovery systems or processes? <br> - Communications: How will restoration procedures be communicated within the organization and with those directly affected by the attack, including end users and IT staff? <br><br> Here is my respond: The company faced a security incident when all network services stopped responding. The cybersecurity team discovered that a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack using a flood of ICMP packets caused the disruption. In response, the team blocked the attack and temporarily shut down non-critical services to restore the critical ones. |
| 2 | `Identify` the following: <br> - Technology/Asset: Which system and devices were affected? <br> - Process/Business environment: Which business processes were affected in the attack? <br> - People: Who needs access to the affected systems? <br><br> Here is my respond: A malicious actor targeted the company with an ICMP flood attack, impacting the entire internal network. All critical network resources had to be secured and restored to normal operation. | 
| 3 | `Protect` and implement safeguards: <br> - Access controls: Who needs to the affected items? How are non-trusted sources blocked from having access? <br> - Awareness/Training: Who needs to be made aware of this attack and how to prevent it from happening again? <br> - Data security: Is there any affected data that needs to be made more secure? - Information protection and procedures: Do any procedures need to be updated or added to protect data assets? <br> - Maintenance: Do any of the affected hardware, OS or software need to be updated? <br> Protective Technology:  Are there any protective technologies, like a firewall or an intrusion prevention system (IPS), that should be implemented to protect against future attacks? <br><br> Here is my respond: The cybersecurity team added a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets and implemented an IDS/IPS system to filter out ICMP traffic with suspicious characteristics. |
| 4 | `Detect` threats and attacks: <br> - Anomalies and events: What tools could be used to detect and alert IT security staff of anomalies and security events, such as a security information and event management system (SIEM) tool? <br> - Security continuous monitoring: What tools or IT processes are needed to monitor the network for security events? <br> - Detection process: What tools are needed to detect security events, such as an IDS? <br><br> Here is my respond: The cybersecurity team set up source IP address verification on the firewall to detect spoofed IP addresses in incoming ICMP packets and installed network monitoring software to identify abnormal traffic patterns. |
| 5 | `Respond` to threats and attacks: <br> - Planning: What action plans need to be implemented to respond to similar attacks in the future? <br> - Communications: How will security event response procedures be communicated within the organization and with those directly affected by the attack, including end users and IT staff? <br> - Analysis: What analysis steps should be followed in response to a similar attack? <br> Mitigation: What responding steps could be used to mitigate the impact of an attack, such as offlining or isolating affected resources? <br> Improvements: What improvements are needed to improve response procedures in the future? <br><br> Here is my respond: In future security events, the cybersecurity team will isolate affected systems to prevent further network disruption. They will prioritize restoring any critical systems and services impacted by the event. Afterward, the team will analyze network logs for suspicious or abnormal activity. All incidents will be reported to upper management and, if necessary, to legal authorities. |
| 6 | `Recover` affected systems or data: <br> - Recovery planning: How will resources be restored following an attack? <br> - Improvements: Do any improvements need to be made to the current recovery systems or processes? <br> - Communications: How will restoration procedures be communicated within the organization and with those directly affected by the attack, including end users and IT staff? <br><br> Here is my respond: To recover from an ICMP flood DDoS attack, network services must be restored to normal operation. In the future, external ICMP flood attacks can be blocked at the firewall. Non-critical network services should be temporarily stopped to reduce internal traffic, while critical services are restored first. Once the ICMP flood subsides, non-critical systems and services can be brought back online. |
