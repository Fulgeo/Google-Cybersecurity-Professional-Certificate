| No           | Least Privilege        | Employees have access to customer data, which needs to change to reduce the risk of a breach.      |

| ?            | Password Policies       | A password policy exists, but the requirements are weak, putting identity management at risk.       |
| Yes          | Antivirus              | The antivirus software is active and regularly monitored by the IT team.                            |
| No           | Backups                | Similar to the disaster recovery plan, they are not prepared for a breach. They need a backup plan. |

| No           | IDS                    | This would help the IT team identify possible intrusions by threat actors.                          |
| Yes          | Storefront             | Although the IT team is not responsible for storefront management, the organization should have sufficient locks. |
| Yes          | CCTV                   | The system is working and functioning properly.                                                    |
| Yes          | Fire Detection         | The organization has fire detection systems, but the team should maintain them and establish a plan for their use. |
